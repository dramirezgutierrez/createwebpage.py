# createwebpage.py
# Character Webpage Generator

## Purpose
This program allows users to generate individual HTML pages for characters from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." It takes user inputs such as character name, actor name, description, and image URL to create formatted HTML files.

## Usage
1. **Required Folders and Files**
   - The program must be located in a folder named `midterm` on your Desktop.
   - Inside this folder, create another folder named `assets`.
   - Place the following files inside the `assets` folder:
     - `page-header.txt`
     - `page-footer.txt`
     - `styles.css` (if you wish to customize the appearance)
   
2. **Running the Program**
   - Open your Python environment (IDLE or command line).
   - Run the `create-webpage.py` script.
   - When prompted, input:
     - The name of the HTML file you wish to create (without the `.html` extension).
     - The character's name.
     - The actor's name.
     - A description of the character.
     - The URL or path to an image of the character.

3. **Expected Output**
   - An HTML file will be created in the same directory as the script, formatted with the inputted details.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that the paths for the template files are correct in the script.
- If any required files are missing, the program will raise an error.
- The generated HTML files are mobile responsive and customizable.

## Example Character Pages
- King Arthur
- Sir Galahad the Pure
- Sir Lancelot the Brave
- Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot
- Sir Bedevere the Wise

## Contribution
Feel free to modify and customize the template files as needed to enhance the generated pages.
